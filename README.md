# Turtle Quick Link

## Description

Inspired by the amazing retail and classic addon [Wowhead Quick Link](https://github.com/NielsHeltner/wowhead-quick-link), **Turtle Quick Link** provides similar functionality for **Turtle WoW players**, but uses [Turtle WoW's Database](https://database.turtle-wow.org/) links as the source of information.

**⚠️ Currently, the addon only supports items.** Vanilla WoW's API differs significantly from the modern version, so retrieving data for other things requires different approaches. However, I aim to extend compatibility to chat links, quests (including pfQuest tracker) and NPCs.

## How to Use

1. Hover your cursor over the **item** you want to link
2. Press **CTRL-C** (configurable in Key Bindings)
   → A pop-up frame will display the link
3. Press **CTRL-C again** (non-configurable) to copy it
4. Close the window with **ESCAPE**, **ENTER**, or **SPACE**
