# Turtle Quick Link

## Description

Inspired by the amazing retail and classic addon [Wowhead Quick Link](https://github.com/NielsHeltner/wowhead-quick-link), **Turtle Quick Link** provides similar functionality for **Turtle WoW players**, but uses [Turtle WoW's Database](https://database.turtle-wow.org/) links as the source of information.

A lot of the sources require [pfQuest](https://github.com/shagu/pfQuest) and [pfQuest-turtle](https://github.com/shagu/pfQuest-turtle) for them to work or to be more precise, so a really recommend installing both.

## Accepted Sources

-   **Items in bags and bank** (and other places probably)
-   **Item links in chat**: Click the link, then press CTRL-C on the tooltip
-   **Quest links in chat**: Requires pfQuest (usage same as item links)
-   **Quests in quest log**: Requires pfQuest for non-english languages and for more precision (english-only without pfQuest)
-   **Quests in pfQuest tracker**: Requires pfQuest
-   **Quest markers on world map**: Requires pfQuest
-   **Quest markers on minimap**: Requires pfQuest
-   **NPCs in the world**: Requires pfQuest

## How to Use

1. Hover your cursor over the **item** you want to link
2. Press **CTRL-C** (configurable in Key Bindings)
   â†’ A pop-up frame will display the link
3. Press **CTRL-C again** (non-configurable) to copy it
4. Close the window with **ESCAPE**, **ENTER**, or **SPACE**
